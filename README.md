#what is okapi?
It might look like our name stands for "okay API" if you are familiar with software engineering. However, our name references the okapi: an artiodactyl mammal native to the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. And we would also like to believe that any API we make is more than okay.
